0,"Solve the problem that the infusion process of the ambulance in the cold and cold areas is too cold to cause adverse effects on the patient's bodyThe existing product in the market is to fix the top of the infusion tube on the hanging rod to heat the liquid. This heating method has a relatively large heat loss. When the temperature is very low, the heated liquid enters the human body through the 1.2-meter infusion tube, which will cause a lot of loss. heat. At the same time, the fixed design is not suitable for use in the rescue process.
In addition, each ambulance needs to be equipped with certain medical equipment. There are 10 medical equipment lists in the ""Ambulance Medical Equipment Configuration Standard (Draft for Comment)"". Fixed equipment warmed to 37 degrees is included in type B (ambulance) and type C (mobile monitoring unit), blood is refrigerated, and blood bags need to be warmed to about 37 degrees before transfusion to patients. , and this fixed heating device is not suitable for infusion bags.During the first aid, the ambulance will carry out infusion therapy according to the patient's condition. For example, a patient with hypovolemia and shock needs to input 2000ml of liquid within two hours, a bottle of mineral water 500ml, 2000ml is equivalent to 4 bottles of mineral water. Our normal infusion rate is 5ml per minute, about 60 to 80 drops per minute, while the infusion rate for patients with insufficient blood volume needs to reach 15ml per minute, and the infusion rate for renal failure patients undergoing tentative rescue needs to reach 25ml per minute. 300 drops per minute. After such a large amount of liquid is injected into the human body, the body temperature of the patient will drop by 1 to 2 degrees. For every 1 degree drop in body temperature, the activity of enzymes will drop by 50%, the immunity of white blood cells will drop by 37%, and the metabolic capacity of the body will drop by 12%. It affects the patient's level of recovery. When the cool liquid enters the blood vessels, the patient will experience local pain, and it will also increase the risk of phlebitis. The decrease in body temperature and the increase in the oxygen consumption of each body will cause the patient's heart rate to increase and cause palpitation. If it is a woman who is menstruating, it is prone to functional uterine bleeding, which increases the disease.1. Wearable design, U-shaped heating groove, wear it on the wrist when using, press the infusion tube into the U-shaped groove, while increasing the heating area, it can effectively fix the infusion tube and prevent the needle from bumping and shaking on the road. fall off.
2. Select the method of heating at the end of the infusion tube. The cool liquid flows through the wrist and is heated and directly enters the blood vessel to reduce heat loss.
3. The built-in 3000mAh lithium battery can save energy and increase battery life due to the heating method at the end of the infusion tube. At the same time, it does not affect the movement of the patient.",CD202234082,急救输液加温器

13,"Handshaker is a home hospice product and service system design including APP and hardware productsHandshaker is based on my country's current medical resource conditions and the design of the home hospice product service system designed by the domestic Internet medical market.With the increasing aging of the domestic population, the promotion of hospice care services has become an issue that must be addressed. Although national policies have been tilted toward the construction and promotion of hospice care in recent years, the promotion and development of hospice care in China is hindered by the fact that hospice care, as a product of the West in recent times, has conflicting concepts with the traditional East Asian cultural context and the low level of medical infrastructure in China. In-home hospice care is more in line with the traditional filial piety concept in China and has a higher acceptance rate. The existing medical resources in China are concentrated in large general hospitals and specialized institutions, which prevent medical resources from reaching the home environment of the terminally ill.Handshaker allows terminally ill patients to be cared for remotely by a team of professionals in their homes, meeting the socio-emotional needs of the patient during the end-of-life period while reducing anxiety about death and ensuring the patient's physical comfort. We provide real-time professional nursing guidance and psychological counseling to family members who wish to care for patients at home, reducing the fear and helplessness of family members who are unable to seek help in time due to the patient's sudden onset of symptoms at home. By establishing a real-time patient record management system, we help GPs, counselors, and nursing staff to have a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's real-time status and improve the efficiency of work handover.",CD202234807,Handshaker
14,"Based on the method of neck auscultation, this project designs a swallowing disorder detection system based on deep learning, which can diagnose the swallowing condition through the swallowing sound of patients during swallowing.(1) The product hardware adopts flexible sensor and flexible structure, which makes the wearable device more suitable for the audience and will not cause discomfort to patients. However, swallowing endoscopy and fluoroscopy swallowing examination are mostly used in the market. Although they can intuitively observe the situation of patients, they will cause inevitable secondary injury to patients. In addition, the hardware integrates battery module, eps32 module and related processing module, which greatly reduces the space occupied by each module when considering the wearing experience, so as to bring patients with lightweight and comfortable experience.
(2) For the software part, patients can download the software in the software store by themselves, and there is no charge item in the software. Patients only need to bear the purchase cost of hardware equipment. At present, the treatment methods of patients with dysphagia on the market are single, and some equipment can only be used in specific institutions. Our equipment enables patients to use software to analyze swallowing conditions without leaving home for hardware detection, so as to achieve long-term detection.
At present, in the swallowing detection industry, swallowing endoscopy and fluoroscopy swallowing examination are mostly used in the market. Although they can intuitively observe the situation of patients, they will cause inevitable secondary injury to patients. Because the flexible sensor is used in this project, it will not cause any harm to patients. Entering the industry has high technical requirements, because the evaluation standard of swallowing is not easy to judge. At present, stroke is the disease with the highest mortality in China, and stroke will lead to swallowing dysfunction, so the current swallowing evaluation market is very huge. And with the gradual increase of the share of household medical market, our hardware products will usher in sustainable development.(1) Independently designed product form, hardware integrated esp32 audio development board + flexible sensor + Bluetooth module + noise acquisition microphone, and collected audio data using voice enhancement algorithm, noise reduction algorithm and audio automatic gain algorithm.

Patients from diverse cultural backgrounds can be matched with advocates from similar regions to understand their needs and provide adequate assistance.**Medical care goes beyond language and understanding at a health level; people also seek empathy and to be understood. Having someone from their own culture can make them feel close to home, significantly when the treatment can be long.**

**Dignifying care cannot be understood if it is not inclusive. Is imperative for the healthcare system to welcome all patients and make an extra effort to include people from diverse cultures by eliminating all the barriers that are getting in the way of people staying on top of their health. We believe this solution would help to eliminate language barriers and cultural gaps within the health system.****Navigating care is frustrating, but accessing care in a different country and in another language is even more complicated.**

**This is a problem for 3,1 million immigrants living in NYC. A worse problem for over 20% of New Yorkers, who claimed to have limited English proficiency (LEP), and associated difficulties.**

**By interviewing 13 participants that have experienced long-term treatment in the USA (such as physiotherapy and cancer). We discovered the main pain points of international patients when accessing care, receiving care, and getting post-care were. The most prominent issues were the following:**

- **Lack of empathy & belonging**
- **Unaware of eligible services & cost**
- **Lack of guidance to anticipate possible problems**
- **Service offered at the wrong moment or late**
- **Communication gap & language barriers**
- **Ambiguity about the functioning of the healthcare system in the U.S.****Some of the main concerns of patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) have with their translator/interpreter service is that their privacy would be compromised and/or their bills would be higher. In addition, the existent training to become a certified interpreter does not provide interpreters with the tools to empower patients with adequate assistance to overcome cultural differences and mindset gaps which plays a critical role in making the right decisions.**

16,"This product is a wearable sudden cardiac death warning system based on deep learning, which helps patients with cardiovascular diseases to warn and send help messages.The first stage is the sensor AgCl electrode, which converts biological signals (ECGs) into voltages. The second stage is a low-pass filter designed to cut off at 100Hz. Low-pass filters are implemented as cascaded RC or passive filters.
Numerous clinical studies have found it feasible to predict the development of ventricular arrhythmias by analyzing and measuring several markers associated with changes in ECG conduction and repolarization. Some of the most explored predictors in clinical practice are based on repolarization, including QT intervals and their correction by heart rate, QT dispersion, intervals from peak to T wave end (TpTe) and T wave alternators (TWA) from arrhythmia risk markers, and SCD prediction of five arrhythmia risk markers for arrhythmias at an early stage.
Finally, automated prediction strategies with various machine learning methods were evaluated and then compared to each other to better classify normal and SCD groups such as KNN, DT, SVM, RF, and NB.
According to studies, sudden cardiac death accounts for 80% of the total sudden death rate, and cardiovascular disease is one of the major diseases that threaten human life and health. Cardiogenic patients have changed from being rescued from sudden onset to being monitored and warned in advance in daily life, and are detected and treated abnormally early.
Few companies on the market today are focused on improving the quality of life for both cardiogenic patients and potentially cardiogenic patients. Some companies on the market do ECG monitoring is based on PPG detection, when the LED light to the skin, the light reflected through the skin tissue is accepted by the photosensitive sensor and converted into an electrical signal and then converted into a digital signal through AD. Because these products use optical monitoring, so the entire monitoring process is inefficient, because the ecglyctic information of cardiac patients needs to be monitored in real time, so the market urgently needs a portable, efficient, high-precision sudden cardiac death monitoring system. Based on this, our company plans to make a wearable cardiac sudden death warning system based on deep learning. 
1. Characteristics of the automatic call system: detect the problem and send a distress signal in time, which is conducive to timely rescue.
2. Automatic measurement of real-time monitoring data features: Bluetooth transmission, the device actively measures the heart rate, and transmits to the mobile phone through Bluetooth, which is convenient for users to watch heart rate data.
3. Wearable features: small size, can be close to the skin, reduce the burden on the user.
4. Lightweight features: Hongmeng APP distributed development, cross-device, seamless collaboration.

18,"FLX is a native mobile APP (Android and iOS) that uses clinically validated algorithms to help prevent musculoskeletal disease and injury; treat pain; and support healthy movement.

FLX uses advanced biomechanics understanding and tailored physiotherapy exercises to deliver its efficacy. FLX uses algorithms developed in a patient group of 4000 subjects that allow us to personalise our programmes to the users needs.  We are the only digital product that can do this without the review or involvement of a physiotherapist, it is all done algorithmically; we are the only product that PREVENTS rather than just treats.

We have six clinical studies that support our product:
F0001 = 4000 patient study of biomechanics that forms the basis of the algorithms.
F0002 = pilot study to confirm the efficacy of the algorithms in preventing musculoskeletal disease and pain; and supporting movement (n=237)
F0003 = confirmatory efficacy study (n = 61)
F0004 = pain study in health club setting (n = 81)
F0005 = pain study in NHS patients (n = 282)
F0006 = validation of algorithms in physiotherapy triage (n = 118)

We have worked on many global pain brands with consumers who experience body pain in our corporate lives (Nurofen; Advil; ThermaCare; Panadol; Anadin; Fenbid; Brufen; Centrum; MoveFree; etc) and understand the key consumer insights and unmet needs around pain, we built FLX to meet the key insights around Body Pain:

Body pain is a high proportion of pain incidence (around 40% of all pains) but interestingly it is often not treated using standard OTC's (60% untreated) because:
- People are concerned about side effects
- Sceptical about whether products will work (topical NSAIDs, APAP, supplements, etc.)
- They accept body pain as a natural consequence of ageing, and are concerned that if they treat when they are younger they will become tolerant so it won't work when they really need it (when they are olde) or they may become dependent or addicted to pain medicines
- Sufferers of body pain use a whole repertoire of products to deal with pain (pills, gels, patches, heat, cold, support, massage, supplements, etc) and tend to favour non-medicinal or holistic solutions

For all these reasons we think that FLX can be an excellent adjunct to a brands with a musculoskeletal or body pain consumer.  It can be used alongside other products and can help minimise the use of traditional OTC products.

There is also an enormous trend for PREVENTION in OTC and health in general.  FLX is one of very few options proven to prevent pain.
FLX is based on our Intrinsic Biomechanics Model which enables us to identify biomechancial dysfunction to intervene before musculoskeletal health issues arise, thereby preventing musculoskeletal disease.  This differs from standard physiotherapy which addresses the symptoms rather than addressing the root cause, and consequently has high rates of recurrence.  FLX solves the route cause are reduces the rate of recurrence.

FLX has 3 main claims areas:
1.  Prevents body by reducing risk of musculoskeletal disease, pain and injury (reduces risk of musculoskeletal disease by up to 60%)
2.  Treats pain (causes up to 70% reduction in pain, 10% is considered clinically relevant)
3.  Supports healthy movement and function (increases flexibility 149%, mobility 42%, and function by 95%)

28,"Neckair is a smart wearable device that helps patients with thyroid and endocrine diseases to complete long-term health management through artificial intelligence.The database is the basis for ensuring that our products work effectively. Based on scientific research papers, we have broken down the endocrine health of the neck into two information dimensions, voice and nature of the mass, to support AI judgements.

(1) Regarding the voice, according to existing medical research, abnormalities in the endocrine system can lead to changes in the voice. The product, therefore, collects daily acoustic data (including range, fundamental frequency, overtones and signal-to-noise ratio) from the user via a shotgun-type unidirectional microphone. This data is recorded into a database for disease determination.

(2) Regarding the condition of neck lumps, the initial clinical judgement is made by visual observation and palpation. The Tof camera in the product acquires 3D neck data to determine the lump's size and shape. At the same time, other properties of the lumps (hardness, etc.) are entered through natural language processing.

(3) The micro laser projection uses the skin as an interactive interface to guide the self-examination, combining the data captured by the camera to achieve real-time focus and positioning of the projected content. Hand tracking is achieved by image recognition with planar heat mapping to locate joint points.Neck endocrine health problems (neck lumps, goiter, etc.) are universal and long-term accompanying. However, since such health problems require long-term attention and health guidance, patients often suffer from anxiety or lack of attention resulting in negative consequences (e.g., wasted medical resources, worsening of disease). However, the health market focusing on endocrine neck problems is not yet enlightened. With the development of artificial intelligence, personalized health smart management will become mainstream. By Combining the neck endocrine health management gap with patients' needs, Neckair will not only provide health benefits to users but also create social values, such as early screening of diseases, knowledge graph establishing, reducing over-medication and medical resources overstretch, etc.In the neck wearable category, Neckair is unique in its focus on endocrine disorders of the neck. With intelligent solutions, Neckair opens up the market for endocrine neck health with a new entry point.
1. Leveraging the strengths and advantages of AI to provide multi-dimensional integrated disease judgement and assisted decision-making, magnifying small changes in disease and visualising senseless endocrine diseases.
2. Using the skin as a direct interaction interface, combined with AI algorithms, to provide a more intuitive and easy-to-understand interaction.
3. Integrating health care into life. Daily soothing and relaxing behaviours (hot compresses, listening to music) are used as drivers for long-term health management. The unconventional shape creates a ritualistic technological atmosphere for the user.",CD202236585,Neckair 智能颈环

Fusion360 independently conceived and designed this multi-functional product integrating data collection, data processing, classification processing, data upload and so on. In terms of internal layout, reasonably plan the location of development board, loudspeaker, Bluetooth hardware module and rechargeable battery to ensure the best recording effect
According to relevant statistics, the number of children with autism spectrum disorders is growing at a rate of 200000 / year worldwide, while in China, children with autism spectrum disorders have been listed as the first mental disability. The prevalence of knowledge about autism spectrum disorders in China is low, and there is no unified diagnostic standard for diagnosis. Due to the lack of scientific and accurate detection instruments in diagnosis, the average age of actual screening and diagnosis is 4-5 years old, far behind the best opportunity for early screening and diagnosis from 18 to 24 months.
The project can advance the actual screening and diagnosis age of patients with autism spectrum disorders from four to five years old to 14 to 15 months after birth, so that children with autism spectrum disorders can be diagnosed very early, so as to carry out intervention treatment very early, and minimize the impact of this natural developmental disorder on patients and the whole family.
The artificial intelligence technology is first applied to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. The acoustic feature filtering recognition and diagnosis system for children with autism spectrum disorders has a significant effect on shortening the diagnosis time and improving the diagnosis rate of autism spectrum disorders.

32,"SimbaSmile is a Kenyan digital dental solutions company that helps patients improve their smiles by locally manufacturing and distributing clear aligners. Our holistic approach addresses gaps in the East African dental markets which greatly hinder customer satisfaction by minimizing how much bang they get for their buck.There is a huge potential in this industry. Many of the processes can be automated such as trimming the aligner models, which can be replaced by laser cutting technology. Research is also being carried out on shape memory polymer resins which would revolutionize the aligner technology by 3D printing the aligners directly, eliminating some of the processes in the middle. This would make dental healthcare even more affordable for KenyansOur smiles are part of our personalities, and they have a direct effect on your confidence levels. Most people have crooked teeth due to various reasons; some being genetic, poor nutrition, poor dental care, malocclusion, facial injuries or habits such as thumb sucking. 
Crooked teeth not only affect your confidence but can also lead to problems such as gum disease, difficulty in eating, low self-esteem and faster wear and tear of your teeth. The silver lining and one of our core ethos is that crooked teeth can be straightened.
SimbAligners, the clear aligners produced by SimbaSmile uses cutting edge technology to produce aligners that can help straighten patients’teeth. They are more comfortable than braces as the patient can remove them whenever he/she is eating, drinking, brushing their teeth. They are also designed to be barely noticeable, having an aesthetic advantage over braces. They can also achieve results in short periods of time for simple teeth movements.
We have a unique payment model whereby patients pay depending on the number of aligners they need, making it one of the least expensive clear aligner payment models. Invisalign, our biggest competitor provides the clear aligner treatment at 2 to 3 times our prices.
Why?
Clear aligners were initially designed to help patients straighten their teeth without the use of braces. You can easily remove them when eating and brushing your teeth and they are barely noticeable. However, clear aligners produced in western countries are extremely expensive creating barriers to access in the Kenyan market. A great smile is more than just a great confidence booster, and this can confidence can translate into many other positive changes.
How?
We are using 3D Scanners to scan an intraoral image of a patient’s teeth. A dental expert uses the scan to design the individual movements of each tooth. The patient is then able to see what his or her teeth would look like post treatment and approve the design. We then 3D Print the models used to produce the aligners.
What?
The aligners themselves are made from a thermoplastic clear material that resembles the shape of your teeth. They apply pressure on your teeth, pushing them towards the desired position.

33,"The device offers a solution to the problem of the backache, helping many people suffering from this symptom. RAY is a miniaturized and adjustable device for monitoring of movement characterized by a “soft case” and by the connection to secondary devices for the postural education.The possible future uses of RAY are numerous and they regard the target audience on the one hand (there is more and more interest in the postural re-education of the school- age child) and the extension of the field of application on the other hand, thus not limiting the device to monitor the spine. “Ray” has got a lot of potentialities because it is designed to be used in three cases:  prevention, back pain treatment and rehabilitation. In particular the device can be used, upon suggestion of the specialist, for the treatment of: chronic back pain due to an incorrect posture, already treated traumas (…), dysformisms of the spine, other cases in which monitoring of the patient’s posture is requested, physiotherapy and controlled postural training. The prevention is useful in the case of children or adults with a scoliotic attitude and people who for work are more exposed to the risk of disorders onset or pathologies connected to the rachis. The device can be sold to pharmacies, specialized clinics and professionals in the field (posturologists, physioterapists, physiatrists…) who can give the device for “rent” o “purchase in installmets” for the necessary period of time.
RAY is at the moment in the “concept” phase and next step is the realization of a “Minimun Viable prototype”. In particular will be needed in the future phases: a technician for the assembly of electronic/sensor components, designer of circuits for the PCB boards, a software programmer. The following steps are prototyping of the serpentine and of the miniaturized clamp (components which are not available on the market as they are the innovation parameters of the invention), prototyping of the silicone “case”, the test of the functioning of  bioadhesive patches, final tests of the complete functioning of the product.
RAY turns out to be a unique device, while being adjustable and adaptable to all kinds of back. This makes it easily wearable by the user and it reduces the production costs. The weak point is the cost for the initial prototype and of various medical tests. 
The cost of the device with 4 initial sensors is about 9.000 euros, in addition to the costs for the specialists amounting to about 8.000 euros and 20.000 euros for the tests.
In Italy RAY has been the corporate purpose of the innovative Start-Up EGO STUDIO s.r.l. but even if the invention won a mention at the “Compasso d’Oro”, the start-up closed down due to Covid-19.
RAY offers several advantages compared to its competitors as it is more precise, miniaturized, and considerably more ergonomic (thanks to the “ soft case”), comfortable to wear, it does not disturb in the daily activities and it is connected to secondary devices. Furthermore, the specialist doctor can follow more patients at a distance and can adapt the device to any type of person at his choice, thus offering a better service. The RAY system is composed of 3 devices: main device, a ring and a mobile device. The main device, on inertial basis, is positioned near the rachis directly on the skin thanks to biomedical patches. This serves for monitoring, processing and sending data to the related software (installed on sensors, mobile phones, tablets, PCs). A connected ring has been developed to support the main device, and it has the peculiarity to communicate with the patient through a luminous feedback if he has got an incorrect posture or he stays too long in the same position. The connections between the various units take place thanks to an elastic “serpentine”-shaped mechanism which is adjustable and therefore adaptable to every part of the body, thanks to the particular “clamp” system.
The innovation, concerning the material, lies on the use of a “soft”, flexible and biocompatible material: silicone. This replaces the rigid “case” we are usually used to, offering a protection to the technical parts (sensor unit and mother unit), keeping the flexibility of the electronics anyway.
The technical components have been miniaturized in comparison to what exists on the market thanks to the displacement of the power source unit as compared to the sensor unit. Inside this latter unit there is an inertial sensor, while in the mother unit there is a microprocessor, a Bluetooth and a battery.

In particular, the inefficient system and low quality service prevent the public from getting medical treatment and result in high cost. These problems are caused by a lack of medical information, unbalanced distribution of resources and inadequate supervision mechanisms. The system aims to tackle real issues of the hospital and thus create a smart hospital with a “healthy” life cycle based on data sharing, inter-connectivity, expansion and sustainable development. While improving the overall quality of the medical services, the system can bring more value to the managers, health workers, patients and logistics managers as it can improve patients’ experience, reducing medical staff’s working load, improving the safety and efficiency of the logistics management and effectively lowering the operation cost. Also, this system can be extensively applied to other hospitals and it can help to drive the overall smart management in the sector.Take the top-level design of hospitals as a starting point, we try to reconstruct the management logic of smart hospitals with self-designed user system, and build a smart hospital operation and maintenance management system to cover the whole scenario of hospital life-cycle management. The system integrates all the data in every department of the hospital with 5G, big data, cloud computing and AI to connect information, technology and equipment and hospital operators. In doing so, it can facilitate cross-department decision-making and resource coordination, such as knowing patient’s transfusion state in a real time manner and give in-time feedback and service. The system relies on the digital twin model to reflect the physical structure of the hospital and allows easy switch between different scenarios and perspective to have an immersive understanding of the real situation. Data are gathered and analyzed in terms of security, building management, personnel, and medical waste, and some critical index are demonstrated in a systematic manner.

Therefore, intelligent application combined with big data is a good way to help the epidemic.① Community closure leads to limited scope of activities and boring life; ② There are difficulties and potential safety hazards in the nucleic acid detection process, and the results and progress are not visualized; ③ During the epidemic, psychological stress is too great, which is easy to produce psychological diseases such as anxiety and depression; ④ Looking for great inconvenience in the process of seeking medical treatment or purchasing drugs; ⑤ Personal information disclosure in the process of information statistics; ⑥ Social discrimination caused by the wrong understanding and fear of the epidemic in society; ⑦ The masses do not cooperate and do not understand the work, which aggravates the difficulty of social work; ⑧ The timeliness of reporting livelihood issues is not guaranteed;Community epidemic prevention has played a key role in the war of epidemic without smoke. Measures such as containment control, access management, temperature measurement and disinfection have effectively contained the spread of the epidemic. However, the problems behind this are lack of manpower, difficult management, low detection efficiency, lack of information collection and other problems. The design innovation is mainly carried out from the following three aspects:
2. Orderly testing process: through online release of guidance notes for learning the testing process in advance, individuals can clearly define the testing specifications before testing, and make an appointment for the time and place, which can effectively guide the testing work. 
3. Long term health testing: pay attention to the health testing needs of long-term residents, and combine personal identity information with health diagnosis and treatment information.",CD202238069,助力小区防疫的核酸检测服务设计
40,"AI + intelligent hardware + cloud platform - intelligent diagnosis and precise rehabilitation strategy push, making facial paralysis rehabilitation more scientific and efficientThe proposal is aimed at the current pain points of facial paralysis rehabilitation treatment, and through serious games, on the basis of paying attention to the patient's mental health, health recovery is beneficial to the development of the patient's physical and mental health, and helps the sick group regain their smile; at the same time, the proposal The product uses artificial intelligence technology to change the old manpower-based diagnosis and treatment methods from the aspects of diagnosis and training, which greatly saves medical resources; the most important thing is that the product is built based on machine learning, and real data is continuously collected during the patient training process. It provides valuable real data resources for the facial paralysis medical database for future professional research and treatment in this direction, which is of great social value.China is one of the countries with the most serious facial paralysis. In the past 10 years, the incidence of facial paralysis and hemifacial spasm among the elderly has increased by 13%, and the number of people with facial paralysis and hemifacial spasm has reached 62 million. More importantly, in the current fast-paced and high-pressure life, the whole people are at a higher risk of developing facial paralysis.
Once the facial paralysis occurs, it will show a distorted facial shape with slanted eyes and mouth, which will bring great inconvenience to the patient's life, and may also stimulate the patient's negative psychology such as inferiority, which greatly affects the patient's physical and mental state and normal. social contact.
At the same time, treatment and control rates for patients with facial paralysis and hemifacial spasm are low. Currently, only 6.1% of patients with acute facial palsy receive correct and timely treatment. Moreover, the current treatment for facial paralysis mainly focuses on drug treatment. Although this method has a rapid onset in the early stage, the long-term effect is not ideal. Therefore, face-to-face paralysis, a high-incidence disease of all ages, requires more healthy and efficient treatment methods.This project uses a rule-based model to extract facial feature points, and uses machine learning algorithms to transform and output some advanced features. The deep learning model is based on the large data set we constructed, using CNN for feature learning, and merging the conclusions of the two models. At present, this AI strategy model is mainly used in two aspects. One is to detect facial feature points and compare them with the features of normal faces in the database, which can effectively identify abnormal points, that is, muscle failures. Second, by uploading facial pictures and videos in the client, the user can obtain the system's feedback of the rehabilitation strategy, realizing the dynamic intelligent service and rehabilitation guidance of the whole process.",CD202238094,FaceHi基于AI深度学习的面瘫患者康复锻炼系统

43,"eCare-app for care center communicate effectivelyAccording to relevant statistics from Taiwan, there are currently 1,091 parent-care institutions in the country, and the number of residents is as high as 49,878. Moreover, it is estimated that Taiwan will have an elderly population of 4.7 million (20.1%) in 2025, which means the increase of long-term institutions and the urgency and demand for the improvement and use of internal systems. 
 Moreover, the study found that the current long-term care system serves management personnel to help them be more efficient in organizing reports, etc., But there is no system designed from the perspective of the attendant. Through eCare, it can reduce the workload of caregivers and create a decentralized service organization.Through an interview with the manager of the Hongdao Foundation for the Elderly, it was found that when the caregiver went to the home service, he would encounter difficulties in calculating the number of hours caused by forgetting to check in. After arriving at the destination, he might find that the elderly were not seen or uncomfortable, and when the caregiver was not familiar enough, he might not know what to do. In addition, the work schedule must be coordinated with the family members, and there is no good work planning layout for the caregivers to organize, which also leads to uneven distribution of their work and service items. 
 When working in the long-term care center, because most of the work tasks must be reviewed by Jufu supervision, the process is too complicated, and the use template of the long-term care center is complex and not systematic. When the work of the caregiver needs to be transferred, it cannot be completely handed over, and the information does not circulate.eCare combines multi-module designed for caregivers and families since they are generally too old to be good at using complex software. Caregivers can schedule work, reduce workload, and communicate effectively with family members. Family members can use this to pay attention to the elderly’s physical condition, learning about their activity information through the contact book system, which helps to communicate transparently.

44,"YueXing TeleRehabilitation System is to help patients at different injury stages with all kinds of orthopaedic problems including postoperative and conservative treatment . We provide digital musculoskeletal solution to improve physical function and reduce pain. Whole system consists of a patient-side APP, a wearable sensor kit, and a clinician-side management systemThe core R&D team of YUEXING TeleRehab Digital Therapy consists of 20+ interdisciplinary talents, including orthopedic surgeons& physicians and licensed physical therapists from well-known tertiary hospitals, algorithm engineers, hardware R&D engineers from well-known domestic universities. The built-in rehabilitation programme refers to hundreds of relevant domestic and foreign literatures, clinical guidelines, case studies and has repeatedly scrutinized and confirmed by clinical experts to ensure that they are safe, scientific and effective. 

At present, YUEXING TeleRehab digital therapy has been clinically tested in tertiary hospitals, covering more than 230 patients. Among them, there are about 80 cases of postoperative knee sports injuries, and about 50 cases of patients with low back pain and chronic knee pain. Besides, the overall patient satisfaction score (NPS 0-10) was 9.4. 81% of the patients achieved the expected rehabilitation goals, and 92% of the patients after knee sports injury achieved the expected rehabilitation goals. The average lower extremity function score (LEFS score) was basically the same as that of the patients who rehabilitated in the hospital during the same period; 73% of the patients with chronic low back and knee pain achieved the expected rehabilitation goals. The pain relief rate is 65%. And during the usage process, more than 60% of users practice more than 3 times a week; the total anxiety relief rate of patients is 54%. What’s more no patients have secondary injuries.

Through wearable sensors, multi-modal AI algorithms, instant messaging, cloud computing, etc., We rely on self-developed human pose inertial navigation sensors, App (client), SaaS management platform, AI data analysis platform, etc. The system helps patients realize the integrated diagnosis and treatment of online + offline exercise rehabilitation, mainly starting from the two core functions of diagnosis, evaluation, training and rehabilitation.Rehabilitation talent allocation and rehabilitation service capabilities vary greatly across regions.
At present, there are only 50,000 in-service licensed physical therapists in China, which means 3.6 licensed physical therapists are matched for every 100,000 population. In developed countries such as Europe, the United States, and Japan, it is required to match 30-70 licensed physical therapists for every 100,000 population. The number of physical therapists directly limits the number of patients that can be served. In 2020, 16.02 million people were treated in orthopaedic hospitals in China. Most patients in orthopaedics can benefit from rehabilitation treatment. However, under the condition of insufficient rehabilitation service, high-quality rehabilitation medical resources are concentrated in first and second-tier cities, resulting in many patients were unable to receive rehabilitation treatment in time.

Difficulty in postoperative patient follow-up and patient management
At present, the follow-up management of orthopedic patients in public hospitals is difficult, and patients are often not followed up in time, resulting in the loss of important data and affecting the development of follow-up treatment.1）Different from traditional MSK rehabilitation equipment in China, YueXing TeleRehab can give the care that patients need to overcome function impairments and pain at anytime and anywhere.  1）We have established the first digital clinic of musculoskeletal rehabilitation in China and coined ""Five divisions co-management services"" which includes orthopedic surgeons& physicians, licensed physical therapists, nurses, prosthetist/orthotist and health coach.

Let the empty nest old man pass the isolation period safely! Design a model that allows isolated empty nesters to know their physical conditions (such as body temperature, isolation days, physical conditions, etc.) and consult doctors online according to the situation. In the face of rumors on the Internet, you can avoid rumors through the app function, and you can also find nearby pharmacies through the app's drug search function, find the drugs you need, and deliver them. At present, most of the similar apps I find on the Internet are only for the elderly to ask for medical treatment, endowment insurance and other issues, and do not fundamentally solve the safety problems of the elderly under the epidemic, especially the special group of empty nesters. In view of this situation, this app has great advantages.Isolate the virus without isolating love. While preventing and controlling the epidemic, we should also do a good job in the ""additional problem"" of caring for empty nesters during the epidemic. To build a strong safe harbor for empty nesters requires everyone of us to work together. The national office on aging disclosed that the number of empty nesters reached 118 million in 2020 and is expected to exceed 200million by 2030. Special people who need to be isolated at home due to fever or epidemic: empty nesters, who need to know their physical condition and ask doctors for solutions, are easily fooled in the face of rumors on the Internet. Not only that, many elderly people suffer from chronic diseases, and how to return to the hospital and take medicine has become their ""number one problem"". Their home is far away from the hospital and they need to travel by means of transportation. However, the process of showing the health code is cumbersome, which hinders their travel... When thinking of this, many old people shake their heads and sigh. To solve this problem, we designed an app to solve the life safety problem of empty nesters!① : this app product is innovative

56,"Shixun is a traditional Chinese medicine fumigation product produced under the culture of Shunshi health traditional Chinese medicine. It is mainly aimed at chronic lumbar diseases and solves the problem of home physiotherapy for people with chronic low back pain.Existing products are generally similar in appearance, and there are still shortcomings in terms of ease of use and visualization. While Shifu uses small volume, in order to better achieve the concept of health preservation and recovery, fumigation, moxibustion, and massage are combined with Western medicine dynamic traction. The innovative method of rehabilitation makes it fit the needs of modern aesthetics and functions. With the new human-computer interaction fumigation mode, the user can lie down for physiotherapy to minimize the pressure on the waist of the patient during treatment; instead of cooking the medicine, the method of replacing and recycling the medicine is convenient for the user. Cleaning and assembly; considering the exposed skin of the user and the warmth of the abdomen, a mini moxibustion box is added to ensure simultaneous fumigation and steaming.
In the research of products of the same category, it is found that there are no domestic products for traditional Chinese medicine fumigation in the market. Most of them are moxibustion instruments and small fumigation machines, and the sales are good. In addition, Shixun products are a market gap, and they have market prospects and can be developed in the face of tight medical resources and large demand.1. Most home physiotherapy products in the market are moxibustion physiotherapy, and there are few types of traditional Chinese medicine fumigation. The concept of physical therapy and rehabilitation is a modern way of advocating, but the existing products lack the concept of health care system, and can only achieve basic daily physiotherapy, with low user viscosity and compliance .
2. The patient's treatment process is cumbersome and the journey is long. Most patients with chronic low back pain choose traditional Chinese medicine for treatment. However, compared with the huge population of chronic pain patients, the service capacity of traditional Chinese medicine hospitals is seriously insufficient and the pressure on medical resources is great.
3. Existing medical device products are not friendly enough for patients to use, and there are still many problems, such as poor visualization, difficult adjustment, single functional form, and inability to perform multi-demand physiotherapy for different user conditions; in order to achieve the same physiotherapy effect, the existing fumigation products are professional If it is too strong, the learning cost is high for patients, it is not easy to operate, it is easy to make mistakes when using it, and it is easy to cause users to worry; and the product lacks human-computer interaction, and the user's posture needs to cooperate with the product for treatment.①Change the scene of the original hospital treatment, change the product shape and volume to facilitate home treatment outside the hospital; ②Change the way the original medicinal materials are cooked on the spot, and replace them with liquid medicine modules, which are convenient for cleaning; ③Increase the temperature of the product, the contact surface, etc. can be adjusted At the same time, ensure the airtightness of the air outlet, and solve the problem of waste liquid through the return device; ④Leveraging the traditional Chinese concept of chronological health preservation, replacing the corresponding medicinal liquid for diseases according to the solar terms, it can prevent the possibility of other chronic comorbidities at the same time during treatment; ⑤ Explore new treatment postures, not limited to lying on your stomach, bending over and sitting, the product cooperates with patients to treat in a more comfortable state. ⑥Rethink the interactive form of the product, quantify the fumigation effect data, and relieve the boring mood of the fumigation process; ⑦Add more professional rehabilitation treatment product functions, and can also carry out certain out-of-hospital rehabilitation treatment in the process of giving health care.",CD202239758,顺时养生
57,"4D-FIT is an adaptive fracture brace that solves the pain points of existing braces such as poor fit and inability to adapt to the dynamic process of rehabilitation through 4D printing technology.As an emerging technology, 4D printing is sought after by the market for its foresight and innovation. This design is a bold and successful attempt to grasp the emerging technology and integrate 4D printing technology with fracture support design, applying the emerging technology to daily medical scenarios.
In the specific design, we choose PCL material with high biocompatibility for prototyping and production, and all production indexes are determined according to national standards. The cost of this design is low, if put into the market can reduce the cost of patient care; simple to use, can be convenient for both physicians and patients; with mechanical properties faster, can reduce the patient waiting time for curing. In summary, this design is full of humanistic care, taking into account the social benefits while designing, trying to make the product more suitable for the user and better improve the user's rehabilitation environment.
Overall, this design has strong potential and expandability in both commercial and technical aspects, with wide scope for development, and deserves more in-depth promotion and research.Fracture is one of the most common injuries today. In real medical scenarios, common fracture supports such as plaster and polymer splints have many pain points, including heavy, uncomfortable and uncomfortable hand fit; 3D printed supports are another competitive product in the current market, but the manufacturing of these supports is often time-consuming and costly, and a single product does not have universal applicability.
In addition, we know from the literature that fracture rehabilitation is a dynamic process, but the supports available in the market today are all static and cannot be dynamically adjusted according to the patient's rehabilitation status, which leads to the physician having to change the support for the patient regularly, resulting in a waste of time and money; at the same time, static supports are not conducive to the patient's rehabilitation.
In order to solve the pain points in the new design, we introduced 4D printing technology, hoping to solve the pain points through the new technology, providing convenience for physicians and a better rehabilitation experience for patients.1.The design is based on 4D printing to achieve new functions with new technology. 4D printed products have dynamic characteristics of static structure over time under external stimulation, which meets the demand for dynamic structure. Since the traditional fracture brace and the existing 3D printed brace are static structures, which cannot fully adapt to the dynamic fracture rehabilitation process, integrating 4D printing technology into the fracture brace design can realize the dynamic adaptation of the brace to the rehabilitation condition and facilitate the physician to adjust the brace at any time to help the patient recover better.
2. The design is realized using PCL, a lightweight, low-cost and biocompatible material that is also a smart material for 4D printing. In our experiments, we used this material for finite element analysis, user testing, etc. The results all proved that PCL is suitable for this design. Compared with other products, the quality of the product made by using PCL material with 4D printing technology is lighter, lower cost and more breathable, showing a great advantage over competing products.",CD202239853,4D-FIT——基于4D打印技术的医疗辅助器具设计

The pressure of some residents in life, work, study and other aspects cannot be resolved, resulting in psychological obstacles and psychological problems.
However, China's mental health service resources are short and unevenly distributed, and there is a gap between supply and demand in the mental health service market. The existing mental health resources cannot meet the needs of all residents in mental health services.
From the perspective of children, don't ignore the influence in childhood. Even after mental development, we can enlighten and remedy in time.
Research shows that the psychological damage caused by children's own defects has a great impact on life. If the ""shadow of childhood"" is not enlightened in time, it will have a great impact on people's life.According to incomplete statistical analysis, at least 60% of scar patients have obvious inferiority complex, especially children and women. The inferiority complex of scar patients is aggravated by trauma, acne or scars left on the face after plastic surgery. Some children will feel inferiority complex because of scars or unique birthmarks on their bodies.
We need to make them realize that scars can also be cute, a record of experience, and your unique existence, so as to improve their self-confidence and minimize the secondary damage caused by scars.
Scar island is playful, operational and restorative. The scar Island generated by taking photos makes users feel more involved, and Mr enhances their sense of identity and interesting content to stimulate curiosity. The construction of scar island is corresponding to the psychological repair process of scar trauma, and the two are synchronized.

68,"Smart jewel for symptom control of panic disorder. Ukiyo acts on the two main symptoms of panic attack: palpitation and shortness of breath. The device, a pendant-brooch, is used to normalize the heart rate and to perform correct diaphragmatic breathing, thanks to the help of an app.For the materials, the first choice was to use technical ceramics, also called advanced or high-tech ceramics, for the main shells of the device. The choice fell on this material for its properties such as lightness, resistance and hypoallergenicity. Its use is in fact known in the watchmaking sector, but also in the space and medical sectors by exploiting biocompatibility. Another field of application is the domestic one to produce knives or kitchen utensils.
The starting raw material of high-tech ceramics is often zirconium powder which is processed in a similar way to the pellet of an injection-molded polymer.
For the parts of the translucent shell, injection-molded polycarbonate was chosen, with different finishes. The internal body has a rough texture, but to a lesser extent than the external one to be crossed by the light of the LED below.
The metal components are in aluminum with a matte and colored finish thanks to a PVD treatment.

The metal components are in aluminum with a matte and colored finish thanks to a PVD treatment. Finally, for the accessories, a cord was chosen for the necklace and an eco-leather strap with a metal snap button.Unlike the case studies analyzed, Ukiyo was designed specifically for the management of panic attack and acts on two symptoms: heartache and shortness of breath. In fact, to break the vicious circle of anxiety, the element that triggers the attack, the device shifts the perception of one's beating towards a fake heart that beats at a lower frequency, using the principle of the rubber hand illusion (HRI). To do this, Ukiyo acquires the user's heart rate (with PPG sensor) and simulates the heartbeat through lights and haptic vibrations. This is the moment when the proprioceptive drift towards the fake heart occurs. After a few minutes, the fake heartbeat begins to slow down, giving the individual the perception of gradual relaxation.
As for the sensation of suffocation, another very common symptom, Ukiyo teaches you to practice correct diaphragmatic breathing thanks to the aid of an app with a graphic interface that translates the breaths performed into visual signals. In this case, the device is placed on the abdomen and through an accelerometer it is possible to ""read"" the movements made during breathing. Plus, the app is a community for exchanging advice and a diary of ""panic triggers"", a tool to support psychological therapy.
To avoid nighttime panic attacks triggered by high concentrations of CO2 in the air, Ukiyo is equipped with a sensor that detects carbon dioxide levels beyond certain limits.
The proposed solution is part of the complementary therapies and therefore supports drug and psychological therapy without replacing doctors and psychologists.
Ukiyo goes beyond the classic wearable, it is a smart jewel not to be hidden but to be exhibited both during and before or after use. The contrasting textures give the object an intimate dimension thanks to a tactile sensation that makes it pleasant even with closed eyes.",CD202240828,
